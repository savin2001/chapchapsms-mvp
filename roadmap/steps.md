### ðŸ”§ What's Next?

Here are a few good next steps we can implement:

#### 1. **GET Endpoint to View Messages**

To retrieve all saved messages:

```http
GET /api/messages
```

#### 2. **Basic Web UI to Submit SMS**

A simple HTML form at `/` so non-tech users can send test messages from the browser.

#### 3. **Scheduled Dispatch Stub**

Add a background task placeholder to simulate sending saved messages (can evolve later into actual gateway integration).

#### 4. **Optional: Add a timestamp**

Every saved message can include `createdAt`.

Would you like to:

* Add the `GET` endpoint now?
* Build the frontend form?
* Simulate SMS sending?
  Let me know which to tackle next.
